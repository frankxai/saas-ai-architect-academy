# Sponsor Cockpit Specification

Blueprint for the analytics and governance workspace sponsors use to monitor cohort performance, evidence, and ROI.

## User Types
| Persona | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Executive Sponsor | Portfolio visibility, risk posture, ROI narrative, decision prompts |
| Program Director | Operational health, deliverable status, mentor coordination |
| Compliance Partner | Control coverage, audit readiness, incident tracking |
| Finance Partner | Cost, productivity impact, value realization metrics |

## Core Dashboards
1. **Outcome Pulse**: real-time view of key KPIs (business metrics, delivery velocity, adoption scores).
2. **Evidence Ledger**: summary of approved artifacts, pending reviews, control coverage per learner.
3. **Risk & Governance**: heatmap of risk categories, open incidents, regulatory triggers, renewal windows.
4. **Engagement Insights**: micro-path progress, assistant interaction stats, mentor touchpoints.
5. **ROI Storyboards**: curated slides linking evidence to business outcomes, ready for board updates.

## Data Sources
- Evidence Locker API (artifacts, governance tags, reviewer status).
- Evaluation Ops telemetry (scorecards, anomalies, drift alerts).
- Companion agent wellness signals (aggregated, privacy-preserving).
- Sponsor-specific KPIs (OKRs, financial models) via secure integrations.

## Interactions
- Drill-down from cohort to learner to deliverable with citations and control IDs.
- Request clarification or escalation to mentors/learners; track resolution SLA.
- Approve or comment on credential manifests; provide sponsor attestation.
- Export curated reports (PDF/PowerPoint) with auto-updated charts and narrative overlays.

## Governance Controls
- Role-based access with audit logs; least privilege principle.
- Data residency enforcement; anonymization for PII.
- Quarterly access reviews; auto-expire credentials after contract end.

## Integration Roadmap
- Q4 2025: Launch pilot cockpit with Evidence Ledger + Outcome Pulse.
- Q1 2026: Add ROI Storyboards and sponsor attestation workflows.
- Q2 2026: Integrate scenario simulation (what-if analyses) tied to micro-path adjustments.

## Success Metrics
- Sponsor satisfaction ≥4.8/5 on clarity and usefulness.
- Reduction of manual reporting time by 70%.
- 90% of risk escalations resolved within SLA.
- Increased renewal/expansion rate driven by documented ROI.
