# Teaching & Facilitation Model

## Instructional Pillars
1. **Adaptive Micro-paths**: Learners receive 3-5 day micro-paths recomposed weekly based on telemetry, assistant insights, and sponsor goals. Micro-paths include curated modules, labs, and reflection prompts.
2. **Evidence-before-assessment**: Deliverables are produced prior to assessments; the assistant auto-generates evaluation checklists to prime reflections.
3. **Dual-loop Coaching**: Humans and companion agents co-coach. Mentors focus on nuance and judgment, while agents handle scaffolding, code review, and research synthesis.
4. **Cohort Orchestration**: Every cohort blends role-based guilds (architects, product, risk, ops) and cross-functional squads that ship integrated artifacts.
5. **Responsible Velocity**: Speed is coupled with governance—modules explicitly bind to controls, risk treatments, and policy sign-offs.

## Weekly Cadence Template
| Day | Focus | Surfaces | Agent Roles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Pulse brief + orientation sync | Live briefing, mission updates | Scout curates research; Coach primes weekly plan. |
| Tuesday | Deep work studio | Labs, co-building sessions | Coach + Critic pair to guide builds and evaluation. |
| Wednesday | Governance & feedback | Risk clinics, stakeholder reviews | Critic orchestrates control checks; Archivist logs evidence. |
| Thursday | Frontier & community | Research guild, creator sync, innovation lab | Scout surfaces new intelligence; Companion maps optional modules. |
| Friday | Reflection & planning | Evidence locker update, sponsor comms | Archivist finalizes dossier; Companion drafts sponsor brief. |

## Modality Stack
- **Micro-lessons (ML)**: 10-20 minute interactive MDX with embedded citations; often pre-work for labs.
- **Labs (LB)**: Repo-backed exercises with evaluation bots and mentor critique.
- **Workshops (WK)**: Facilitated applied sessions with breakout boards and real-time artifacts.
- **Sprints (SP)**: Multi-day deliverable pushes with check-ins and telemetry targets.
- **Clinics (CL)**: Targeted peer review, featuring red-team prompts and mentor sign-off.
- **Masterclasses (MC)**: Advanced seminars taught by industry leaders or faculty; recorded with knowledge graph transcripts.
- **Roundtables (RT)**: Stakeholder dialogues driving alignment and policy decisions.
- **Research Sprints (RS)**: Publishable outputs, open-source contributions, or regulatory briefs.

## Assistant Interaction Patterns
- **Pre-briefs**: Learners kick off modules with assistant-generated overviews, context checklists, and risk reminders.
- **Just-in-time retrieval**: Module metadata powers contextual retrieval so the assistant references the latest research, case law, and vendor updates.
- **Critique loops**: Critic agent runs scenario-based interrogation, requiring learners to defend decisions with citations and metrics.
- **Telemetry nudges**: Companion agent monitors pace, highlights overdue deliverables, and prompts rest/reflection when burnout indicators spike.
- **Evidence synthesis**: Archivist agent compiles artifacts into dossier drafts, tagging controls, metrics, and stakeholder notes.

## Evaluation Rubrics
| Dimension | Description | Signals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical Rigor | Architecture integrity, evaluation depth, scalability. | Test results, ADRs, simulation outcomes. |
| Responsible Practice | Control adherence, fairness, transparency, oversight. | Control library coverage, audit logs, risk mitigations. |
| Delivery Excellence | Execution predictability, documentation, stakeholder alignment. | Sprint burndown, communication artifacts, stakeholder feedback. |
| Strategic Impact | Business value, financial cases, change adoption. | KPI models, adoption telemetry, executive endorsements. |
| Leadership & Influence | Narrative clarity, mentoring, community leverage. | Published insights, cohort testimonials, knowledge graph contributions. |

## Support Ecosystem
- **Guilds**: Role-based communities meeting bi-weekly to share playbooks and update standards.
- **Mentor Bench**: Pool of principal architects, governance leads, product strategists; each module indicates mentor touchpoints.
- **Expert-in-Residence Calendar**: Rotating roster of external experts (regulators, venture partners, design leaders).
- **Knowledge Graph**: Learner evidence, vendor docs, regulatory texts linked for retrieval and citation.
- **Community & Family Sync**: Monthly update with simplified narrative, progress milestones, and celebration rituals.

## Inclusivity & Accessibility Practices
- Provide captions, transcripts, and screen reader optimized materials for every session.
- Offer timezone-aware cohort scheduling and asynchronous alternatives for all required artifacts.
- Maintain wellness protocols: optional quiet working sessions, mental health resources, burnout detection triggers.
- Deliver inclusive case studies spanning finance, healthcare, public interest, creative sectors, and global policy contexts.

## Refresh & Quality Management
- Weekly freshness audit ensures modules remain within 90-day research currency window.
- Learner feedback loops feed into backlog triage, ranked by impact and risk alignment.
- Quality assurance guild reviews labs and masterclasses quarterly, updating rubrics and instrumentation guidance.
- Companion agents file freshness tickets automatically when new research surpasses threshold relevance.
