# Module Atlas 2025

This atlas enumerates the modular experiences powering the AI Architect Academy. Modules are grouped by learning galaxy (G0-G11), arc (Core, Systems Studio, Leadership & Influence), and mastery level (Explorer, Builder, Architect, Strategist, Luminary). Each entry exposes format, estimated focus hours, primary outcomes, keystone deliverable, and instrumentation focus so companion agents can recommend the right path on demand.

- **Format codes**: ML (micro-lesson), LB (studio lab), WK (workshop/simulation), SP (sprint), CL (clinic), MC (masterclass), RT (roundtable), RS (research sprint).
- **Instrumentation**: identifies the evidence signal or telemetry emphasised for the module.
- **Hours**: focused learning and creation time; includes synchronous, async, and assistant-paired work.
