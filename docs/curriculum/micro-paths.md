# Adaptive Micro-Paths

This reference library defines persona-specific micro-paths generated by the Companion Agent each sprint. Micro-paths span 3-5 days, mix modalities, and align to telemetry gaps, sponsor outcomes, and mastery goals. Paths dynamically adjust when learners complete modules, fall behind, or surface new evidence.

## Orientation Week Micro-Paths (Week 0)
| Persona | Focus | Sequence | Evidence Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lead Architect | Establish baseline telemetry, charter mission. | G0-C1 → G0-C2 → G1-C1 → Reflection prompt RP-001 | Orientation diagnostic, mission charter draft |
| Program Leader | Align sponsor goals, value metrics. | G0-C1 → G1-C3 → G1-C4 → Communiqué template CT-101 | Sponsor storyboard, finance readiness assessment |
| Risk Partner | Map policy obligations, risk landscape. | G6-C1 → G6-C2 → G0-C6 → Audit pulse AP-101 | Harm taxonomy, risk radar pointers |
| Agent Lead | Configure agent stack, safety guardrails. | G0-C5 → G7-C1 → G7-C3 → Lab reflection LR-007 | Prompt audit trail, guardrail configs |

## Micro-Path Orchestration Logic
- **Telemetry Inputs**: module completion status, evaluation scores, control coverage, stakeholder feedback, wellness signals.
- **Constraint Engine**: ensures prerequisites satisfied, balances modalities, enforces rest/recovery days, and respects sponsor deadlines.
- **Sponsor Overrides**: program leaders can prioritize business-critical deliverables; assistant recalculates supporting modules and evidence.
- **Freshness Engine**: Scout agent updates recommended resources when research diff > threshold or regulation status changes.
- **Reflection Cadence**: each micro-path ends with reflection prompt tiered by mastery level; Archivist captures insights for knowledge graph.

## Micro-Path Templates
- Template JSON stored in `content/micro-paths/*.json` (planned) with fields: `persona`, `phase`, `duration`, `modules`, `deliverables`, `assistantHooks`, `constraints`.
- Companion agent surfaces template variants via `/api/micro-paths?persona=lead-architect&phase=builder`.
- Designers can author new templates by referencing Module Atlas codes and aligning deliverables with Evidence Locker schema.
