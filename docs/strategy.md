# AI Architect Academy Platform Strategy

## North Star Goals
1. **Accelerate value delivery**: reduce the time it takes for AI programs to progress from idea to governed production launch.
2. **Codify excellence**: capture proven architecture patterns, workflows, and governance assets in reusable micro-modules.
3. **Augment architects**: pair every member of the AI program with an intelligent assistant that understands context, constraints, and next steps.
4. **Measure impact**: provide decision-makers with transparent metrics around readiness, risk, adoption, and realized business outcomes.

## Primary Personas
| Persona | Needs | Key Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead AI Architect | Reference designs, implementation accelerators, governance guardrails | Shippable blueprint with staged rollout plan, evaluation strategy, and risk mitigation |
| Program / Product Lead | Roadmaps, stakeholder enablement, progress visibility | Prioritized backlog, aligned stakeholders, value narrative with supporting metrics |
| Risk & Compliance Partner | Policy traceability, approvals workflow, audit trail | Continuous assurance, documented controls, automated evidence collection |
| Executive Sponsor | Strategic clarity, portfolio visibility, ROI signals | Confidence in investment allocation, measurable impact, maturity progression view |

## Experience Pillars
1. **Discover** – marketing and storytelling that communicate value, credibility, and social proof.
2. **Learn** – micro-learning modules, tracks, and assessments tailored to personas and maturity levels.
3. **Build** – project workspaces, templates, labs, and automation hooks that translate knowledge into shipped value.
4. **Assist** – AI Architect Assistant embedded throughout the journey, surfacing context-aware guidance and deliverables.
5. **Operate** – evaluation dashboards, governance centers, and reporting that maintain confidence post-launch.

## Differentiators
- **Truth-first knowledge base**: all content is sourced from vetted casework and the open AI Architect Academy repository.
- **Micro-to-macro**: module structure enables quick wins (micro) while rolling up into full capability programs (macro).
- **Governance baked in**: compliance, security, and risk controls are first-class citizens in learning and execution.
- **Assistant-as-copilot**: context-aware, retrieval-augmented assistant that collaborates on plans, docs, and decisions.

## Launch Scope (Foundations)
- Marketing site with curriculum preview, assistant walkthrough, and waitlist capture.
- Role-based learning tracks and featured modules with deep links to the open repository.
- Assistant prototype powered by curated context slices and evaluation-friendly prompts.
- Feedback loop for early adopters (in-app survey, GitHub discussions, analytics).

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: waitlist signups, activated users, module completions per cohort.
- **Velocity**: reduction in time from discovery to first production pilot.
- **Quality**: evaluation coverage, governance checklist completion, stakeholder satisfaction scores.
- **Engagement**: assistant session depth, module feedback ratings, community contributions.

## Strategic Next Steps
- Finalize the content ingestion pipeline and tagging model for modules.
- Define Supabase schema covering users, cohorts, module progress, assistant sessions, and deliverables.
- Prototype assistant conversation flows (intake, planning, co-build, handover) with transcript logging.
- Partner with 2-3 design partners for alpha feedback across different industries.
