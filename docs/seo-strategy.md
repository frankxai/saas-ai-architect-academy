## On-site Optimization Plan
- Enrich metadata (title, description, keywords, canonical) with pillar terms.
- Anchor sections with descriptive IDs and cross-links (#curriculum, #assistant, #personas, #search, #platform, #roadmap, #knowledge).
- Provide structured data markup (EducationalOrganization + Course).
- Publish obots.txt and sitemap.xml referencing primary routes.
- Interlink landing page with repository artifacts and future in-app routes (tracks, assistant, workspaces, governance, insights).
- Surface API / agent access CTA for autonomous workflows.

## Content & Linking Backlog
- Dedicated pillar routes (/tracks, /assistant, /workspaces, /governance, /insights).
- FAQ/HowTo components targeting long-tail queries.
- Outbound references to authoritative standards (NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001) for credibility.

## Agent-Friendly Considerations
- Offer JSON endpoints for modules, personas, roadmap (upcoming).
- Maintain stable IDs, slugs, and anchor names for scraping.
- Provide OpenAPI/JSON-LD descriptors for assistant integration.

## Measurement
- Monitor organic search queries, CTR, conversion via analytics.
- Track assistant prompt taxonomy to discover new keyword opportunities.
- Review metadata quarterly; iterate with fresh insights from customer research.
