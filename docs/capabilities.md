# Platform Capabilities & Agentic Specs

## 1. Content Ingestion & Knowledge Graph
**Goal**: Transform the open-source AI Architect Academy repository into a structured, queryable knowledge graph powering modules, assistant context, and search.
- **Inputs**: Markdown/MDX files, diagrams, prompts, templates, roadmap JSON, commit metadata.
- **Processing**:
  - MDX parser extracts front matter (goals, prerequisites, deliverables, maturity, tags).
  - Embedding pipeline (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large) writes vectors to Supabase/pgvector.
  - Metadata service maintains relationships (module → pattern → project → governance controls).
  - Daily GitHub Action sync with diff detection and assistant cache invalidation.
- **Outputs**:
  - Supabase tables: modules, module_sections, ssets, elationships.
  - Vector index: module_chunks with semantic search + filtering by persona, maturity.
  - Search API: GET /api/search?q= returning ranked modules + citations.
- **Agentic hooks**:
  - Assistant fetches module_context resolver with preview (title, summary, deliverables, links).
  - Auto-tagging agent proposes new tags; human-in-the-loop review.

## 2. Learning Experience & Pathways
**Goal**: Deliver micro-learning journeys tailored to persona, maturity, and project stage.
- **Features**:
  - Persona + goal-based onboarding (select role, objectives, timeline).
  - Dynamic path builder combining core modules, labs, governance checklists.
  - Progress tracking with streaks, completion criteria, reflective prompts.
  - Collaboration: cohort spaces, comments, shared notes.
- **Specs**:
  - Supabase tables: users, personas, goals, learning_paths, path_modules, progress_events.
  - Server actions: createLearningPath, updateProgress, ecommendNextModule.
  - UI: timeline view, module cards, deliverable upload, assistant sidebar.
- **Agentic hooks**:
  - Assistant monitors progress events, nudges next actions, surfaces relevant modules when a blocker is flagged.

## 3. AI Architect Assistant
**Goal**: Context-aware copilot orchestrating plan synthesis, documentation, governance, and automation.
- **Core flows**:
  - Intake wizard → capture mission, constraints, stakeholders.
  - Plan synthesis → sequence modules, deliverables, evaluation steps.
  - Co-build sessions → code snippets, ADR drafts, stakeholder comms.
  - Governance companion → evaluation checklist, risk posture, regulatory evidence.
- **Architecture**:
  - Conversation store in Supabase (ssistant_sessions, messages, ctions).
  - LLM routing via OpenRouter; system prompt references Academy charter, style guide.
  - Tooling endpoints: generatePlan, draftADR, createEvaluationMatrix, 	imelineUpdate, jiraTicket, slackSummary.
  - Observability via Langfuse (trace per conversation, quality metrics).
- **Agentic automation**:
  - Task graph per request: retrieve context → reason plan → call tools → synthesize → verify → cite.
  - Guardrails: citation enforcement, hallucination checks (RAGAS), privacy redaction.

## 4. Execution Workspaces & Governance
**Goal**: Provide a home for project teams to coordinate, track risk, and centralize evidence.
- **Components**:
  - Workspace dashboard (status, key risks, metrics, assistant insights).
  - Module Kanban → move modules across states (Planned, In progress, Complete).
  - Deliverables locker → secure storage with version history, approvals.
  - Governance center → risk register, control checklists, evaluation dashboards.
- **Data model**:
  - Tables: workspaces, workspace_members, workspace_modules, isks, controls, evidence, evaluations.
  - Integrations: Slack/Teams webhooks, Linear/Jira tasks, GitHub issues.
- **Agentic features**:
  - Assistant watches workspace signals, suggests mitigations, schedules rituals, preps stakeholder updates.

## 5. Insights & Portfolio Intelligence
**Goal**: Give executives and program leads visibility across initiatives.
- **Metrics**:
  - Adoption (modules completed, assistant usage), velocity (cycle time), governance (controls satisfied, evaluation coverage), impact (value outcomes, ROI proxies).
  - Comparative benchmarks by domain, persona maturity, risk class.
- **Delivery**:
  - Insight dashboards with filters, trend lines, highlight cards.
  - Scheduled executive briefs generated by assistant, with citations and recommended actions.
- **Data**:
  - Materialized views in Supabase, analytics store (e.g., BigQuery or PostHog), ETL to aggregate signals.

## 6. Platform Ops & Extensibility
- Feature flag framework for staged releases.
- Marketplace architecture for partner modules (metadata, revenue share, review process).
- API/SDK for enterprise integrations and custom assistants.
- Compliance: audit logging, PII handling, tenant isolation.

## Team Model & Automation
- **Product/Design**: orchestrate discovery, maintain component library, own UX research backlog.
- **Engineering (Full-stack, Platform, ML/Agentic)**: ship features per sprint, invest in testing (unit, integration, assistant evals, governance scenarios).
- **Data/Analytics**: instrumentation, dashboards, insights experiments.
- **Operations/Content**: curate modules, manage partner network, ensure quality.
- **Agent Ops**: maintain prompts, evaluation suites, tool reliability.

Automation supports weekly release cadence: CI/CD (lint, tests, build), content sync jobs, assistant regression evals, analytics ETL nightly, instrumentation alerts.
