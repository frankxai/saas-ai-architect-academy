# AI Architect Academy Curriculum Blueprint (2025 Edition)

## Purpose & Outcomes
The Academy is a precision learning operating system that equips elite AI Architects, program leaders, and governance partners to ship governed, measurable AI outcomes. Graduates consistently:
- Design multi-agent, multimodal platforms that balance velocity, safety, and cost.
- Orchestrate data, model, and experience layers with verifiable evidence and controls.
- Lead executive, regulatory, and community conversations with clarity and confidence.
- Sustain innovation through frontier research, telemetry-informed decisions, and inclusive practices.

## Learning Architecture
Twelve learning galaxies (G0-G11) ladder from launch telemetry to frontier innovation. Each galaxy contains three arcs (Core, Systems Studio, Leadership & Influence) mapped to Explorer → Luminary mastery levels. Shared schemas ensure assistants and mentors can guide learners without redundancy. See `docs/curriculum/architecture.md` for persona journeys, program spine, telemetry fabric, and governance model.

### Mastery Ladder
| Level | Focus | Signature Evidence | Readiness Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explorer | Shared vocabulary, responsible AI foundations, orientation deliverables. | Mission charter, risk radar, orientation diagnostic. | Complete 8 Explorer modules, pass baseline assessment (>=80%). |
| Builder | Applied delivery patterns, evaluation rigor, documentation hygiene. | Studio lab artifacts, assisted evaluation suite, control library draft. | Ship 12 Builder modules including 4 labs, pass governance review. |
| Architect | Systems integration, cross-functional leadership, observability. | Platform blueprint, runbooks, unified telemetry dashboard. | Lead stakeholder critique, achieve SLO targets, publish ADR pack. |
| Strategist | Executive alignment, portfolio orchestration, regulatory readiness. | Executive narrative kit, adoption telemetry, policy-to-control trace. | Facilitate board simulation, maintain governance cadence, secure sponsor sign-off. |
| Luminary | Thought leadership, research synthesis, mentorship, community impact. | Insight kit, open knowledge contribution, cohort mentorship dossier. | Author three knowledge assets, maintain 95% evaluation confidence, mentor two cohorts. |

## Module Atlas
- 216 modular experiences codified in `docs/curriculum/modules.md` with modality, hours, outcomes, deliverables, instrumentation.
- Modules include metadata (`galaxy`, `arc`, `level`, `personaFit`, `prerequisites`, `deliverables`, `evidenceSignals`, `refreshCadence`).
- Assistants compose micro-paths and recommendations using this metadata plus learner telemetry.

## Adaptive Micro-Paths
- Micro-path logic detailed in `docs/curriculum/micro-paths.md` covers orientation, Builder, Architect, and Luminary sequences per persona.
- Paths balance modality mix, ensure rest days, and auto-adjust when sponsor priorities or wellness signals shift.
- Reflection prompts and Archivist cues ensure every micro-path ends with documented learning and evidence updates.

## Teaching & Facilitation Model
- Weekly cadence (pulse briefings, deep work studios, governance clinics, frontier guilds, reflection rituals) described in `docs/curriculum/teaching-model.md`.
- Dual-loop coaching pairs human mentors with assistant guidance to maximize rigor and inclusivity.
- Evaluation rubric dimensions: Technical Rigor, Responsible Practice, Delivery Excellence, Strategic Impact, Leadership & Influence.

## Module Authoring & Quality
- Authoring standards (`docs/curriculum/module-authoring.md`) define front matter schema, workflow, accessibility, localization, and governance gates.
- Curator pods steward galaxies, ensuring 90-day freshness and consistent evaluation hooks.
- Assistant tooling auto-generates reviewer checklists, diff summaries, and prompt updates aligned with module metadata.

## Evaluation & QA Operations
- Evaluation pipeline guidance lives in `docs/curriculum/evaluation-ops.md`, covering data curation, run orchestration, anomaly detection, and escalation protocols.
- Evaluation specs, manifests, and scorecards feed directly into Evidence Locker records and credential decisions.
- Severity-driven playbooks align mentors, sponsors, and governance councils on response expectations.

## Evidence Locker & Credentialing
- Evidence Locker specification (`docs/curriculum/evidence-locker.md`) maintains traceable artifacts, governance tags, and hash-based integrity checks.
- Credential framework (`docs/curriculum/credentials.md`) defines Explorer → Luminary badges, specialization seals, VC payload schema, renewal policies, and revocation guardrails.
- Archivist agent packages evidence into verifiable manifests while Companion tracks renewal windows and sponsor attestations.

## Assistant Operations & Safety
- Assistant constellation (Scout, Coach, Critic, Archivist, Companion) governed by `docs/curriculum/assistant-ops.md` with SLOs, telemetry, guardrails, and human-in-loop protocols.
- Policy-as-code guardrails, incident playbooks, and observability dashboards keep automation accountable and auditable.

## Frontier Intelligence Loop
- Intelligence grid (`docs/curriculum/frontier-intelligence.md`) aggregates regulatory, tooling, evaluation, and industry signals for September 2025 relevance.
- Scout agent translates signals into module refresh triggers, risk alerts, and sponsor-ready briefs.
- Curriculum council maintains 90-day freshness SLA with documented change logs in `docs/curriculum/changelog.md`.

## Track Explorer Experience
- `/tracks` specification (`docs/curriculum/track-explorer.md`) outlines adaptive filtering, micro-path timelines, evidence snapshots, and sponsor dashboards.
- APIs expose module manifests, micro-paths, evidence summaries, and intelligence signals for both human UI and agent consumption.

## Evidence & Credentialing Workflow
- Learners maintain Evidence Lockers linking repos, dashboards, transcripts, and stakeholder feedback.
- Automated scoring pipelines capture telemetry from labs, tests, incident simulations, and reviews.
- Governance councils review critical deliverables with decision traceability and policy mapping.

## Roadmap Highlights (Sep 2025)
1. Launch `/tracks` explorer with adaptive filtering and module manifests.
2. Publish assistant rubric scorer MVP integrating module metadata and evaluation heuristics.
3. Release governance API for sponsors to ingest telemetry and credential data.
4. Expand venture studio collaborations (healthcare, finance, public sector) for frontier labs.
5. Pilot alumni fellowship with research stipends, mentorship matching, and open knowledge bounties.
