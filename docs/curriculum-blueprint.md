# AI Architect Academy Curriculum Blueprint (2025 Edition)

## Purpose & Outcomes
The Academy is a precision learning operating system that equips elite AI Architects, program leaders, and governance partners to ship governed, measurable AI outcomes. Graduates consistently:
- Design multi-agent, multimodal platforms that balance velocity, safety, and cost.
- Orchestrate data, model, and experience layers with verifiable evidence and controls.
- Lead executive, regulatory, and community conversations with clarity and confidence.
- Sustain innovation through frontier research, telemetry-informed decisions, and inclusive practices.

## Learning Architecture
Twelve learning galaxies (G0-G11) ladder from launch telemetry to frontier innovation. Each galaxy contains three arcs (Core, Systems Studio, Leadership & Influence) mapped to Explorer → Luminary mastery levels. Shared schemas ensure assistants and mentors can guide learners without redundancy. See `docs/curriculum/architecture.md` for persona journeys, program spine, telemetry fabric, and governance model.

### Mastery Ladder
| Level | Focus | Signature Evidence | Readiness Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explorer | Shared vocabulary, responsible AI foundations, orientation deliverables. | Mission charter, risk radar, orientation diagnostic. | Complete 8 Explorer modules, pass baseline assessment (>=80%). |
| Builder | Applied delivery patterns, evaluation rigor, documentation hygiene. | Studio lab artifacts, assisted evaluation suite, control library draft. | Ship 12 Builder modules including 4 labs, pass governance review. |
| Architect | Systems integration, cross-functional leadership, observability. | Platform blueprint, runbooks, unified telemetry dashboard. | Lead stakeholder critique, achieve SLO targets, publish ADR pack. |
| Strategist | Executive alignment, portfolio orchestration, regulatory readiness. | Executive narrative kit, adoption telemetry, policy-to-control trace. | Facilitate board simulation, maintain governance cadence, secure sponsor sign-off. |
| Luminary | Thought leadership, research synthesis, mentorship, community impact. | Insight kit, open knowledge contribution, cohort mentorship dossier. | Author three knowledge assets, maintain 95% evaluation confidence, mentor two cohorts. |

## Module Atlas & Authoring
- 216 modular experiences codified in `docs/curriculum/modules.md` with modality, hours, outcomes, deliverables, instrumentation.
- Authoring standards (`docs/curriculum/module-authoring.md`) define front matter schema, workflow, accessibility, localization, and governance gates.
- Evaluation references validated against the `docs/curriculum/evaluation-registry.md` to keep metrics authoritative and transparent.
- Research-to-curriculum pipeline (`docs/curriculum/research-pipeline.md`) ensures fresh intelligence flows into module revisions, assistant prompts, and changelog entries.

## Adaptive Micro-Paths & Industry Personalisation
- Micro-path logic (`docs/curriculum/micro-paths.md`) orchestrates persona-specific sequences across orientation, Builder, Architect, and Luminary phases with assistant hooks and reflection prompts.
- Industry playbooks (`docs/curriculum/industry-playbooks.md`) tailor modules, deliverables, compliance signals, and telemetry overlays for healthcare, finance, public sector, manufacturing, creative, and energy cohorts.
- Assistant bundles assemble domain prompts, evaluation checklists, and sponsor narratives to accelerate sector adoption.

## Teaching, Mentoring & Facilitation
- Weekly cadence (pulse briefings, deep work studios, governance clinics, frontier guilds, reflection rituals) described in `docs/curriculum/teaching-model.md`.
- Mentor & cohort operations playbook (`docs/curriculum/mentor-ops.md`) details mentor roles, operating rhythm, tooling, feedback protocols, and sponsor collaboration.
- Dual-loop coaching pairs human mentors with assistant guidance to maximize rigor and inclusivity; evaluation rubric dimensions anchor feedback.

## Evaluation & QA Operations
- Evaluation pipeline guidance in `docs/curriculum/evaluation-ops.md` covers data curation, orchestration, anomaly detection, and escalation protocols.
- Evaluation registry connects metrics, datasets, and governance metadata; Critic agent enforces coverage and sponsors monitor target vs actual performance.
- Severity playbooks and continuous automation ensure regressions trigger timely remediation.

## Evidence, Credentials & Sponsor Experience
- Evidence Locker specification (`docs/curriculum/evidence-locker.md`) maintains traceable artifacts, governance tags, hashes, and jurisdictional controls.
- Credential framework (`docs/curriculum/credentials.md`) defines Explorer → Luminary badges, specialization seals, VC payload schema, renewal policies, and revocation guardrails.
- Sponsor cockpit specification (`docs/curriculum/sponsor-cockpit.md`) provides dashboards for outcomes, evidence, risk, engagement, and ROI storyboards, integrating Evidence Locker and evaluation telemetry.

## Assistant Operations & Intelligence
- Assistant constellation (Scout, Coach, Critic, Archivist, Companion) governed by `docs/curriculum/assistant-ops.md` with SLOs, telemetry, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop protocols.
- Frontier intelligence grid (`docs/curriculum/frontier-intelligence.md`) aggregates regulatory, tooling, evaluation, and industry signals for September 2025 relevance.
- Curriculum council maintains the 90-day freshness SLA with documented change logs in `docs/curriculum/changelog.md`.

## Track Explorer & Platform Integration
- `/tracks` specification (`docs/curriculum/track-explorer.md`) outlines adaptive filtering, micro-path timelines, evidence snapshots, and sponsor dashboards.
- APIs expose module manifests, micro-paths, evidence summaries, intelligence signals, and evaluation registry data for both human UI and companion agents.

## Roadmap Highlights (Sep 2025)
1. Launch `/tracks` explorer with adaptive filtering, evidence overlays, and sponsor exports.
2. Publish assistant rubric scorer MVP integrating module metadata and evaluation heuristics.
3. Release governance API for sponsors to ingest telemetry, credential data, and evaluation registry metrics.
4. Expand venture studio collaborations (healthcare, finance, public sector) for frontier labs and case evidence.
5. Pilot alumni fellowship with research stipends, mentorship matching, and open knowledge bounties.
